    "# Confidence Intervals \n",
    "\n",
    "As you are learning statistics, you start to realise that just because you had calculate one metric does not mean it is statistically significant. For example, you calculated the average revenue of a sample of users on a platform. Do you think this average represents the actual average of your whole user's database? Maybe yes, maybe not ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "What if there was a way to actual tell for sure? Well this can be done using **confidence intervals**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What you're going to learn in this class üßêüßê\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is a confidence interval\n",
    "- How to build them\n",
    "- Understand the difference between precision and accuracy\n",
    "- Create a confidence interval for a mean and for a proportion\n",
    "- Calculate the minimum sample size based on your population parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do we need a confidence interval? \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common problems encountered when conducting an experiment is knowing when **enough data has been collected to make an informed decision**. Although time constraints always come into play, it is vital to understand the consequences of making decisions with a low confidence level. The concept of **statistical significance** is a widely used tool among statisticians to address this very problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we have a sample and calculate statistics, they can be used as a parameter for our population. For example, if you collect data on the age and gender of 100 randomly selected employees at Google, you will have a good idea of the age and gender of the entire population of Google employees. However, these results are inherently imperfect because the population is never perfectly represented. It is to quantify this inaccuracy that the concept of confidence intervals was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "After today's lesson, you will be able to present results in a format that will allow your colleagues to see exactly how accurate your measurements are. Let's look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can say with 95% certainty that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Between 40% and 80% of Google's employees are men\n",
    "2. The average age of employees is between 20 and 40 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "(NB: This data is completely made-up and does not represent the real Google population üòò)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's a confidence interval ‚ú®\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the 95% confidence level means that each time you take a new sample of individuals, there will be a 95% chance that their age is within the defined interval (between 20 and 40 years old). In fact, you also have a 5% chance that the age is outside this interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why not try to have a confidence interval of 99% or even 99.99%? Well, because the higher your confidence level, the wider your interval will be. To continue with the example above. You are 95% certain that the average age is between 20 and 40 years old, you will be as 99% certain that the average age is between 10 and 60 years old. You will have understood it, the whole in statistics is to arbitrate and balance the confidence rate and the confidence interval according to your constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to choose the right confidence interval\n",
    "\n",
    "The desired confidence level (or confidence rating) will depend on **the industry in which you work**. For example, for marketing decisions, a confidence level of 80% is more than sufficient. On the other hand, for the pharmaceutical industry, your confidence level will be higher at 95 or even 99%."

    "## Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem makes all these statistical calculations possible. This theorem states that the larger the samples, the closer the average of all these samples will be to the population average. Moreover, the more samples there are, the closer they will get to a normal distribution **no matter what distribution the sample followed initially**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are dealing with averages when building confidence intervals, this theorem is extremely useful since we can take **any samples** of **any population**, calculate means of each of these samples and **these means will follow a normal distribution**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "As you add more sample means to your dataset, your distribution will converge toward to Normal Distribution:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In terms of sample size, the Central Limit Theorem is considered to take effect from a sample of 30-40 individuals. (In our above example, we took random sample of size 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, this theorem allows us to approximate that any sample of more than 30-40 individuals follows a normal distribution."

    "\n",
    "Now how would you calculate your confidence interval? \n",

In other words, if we repeated the study once again on a different sample, we would probably get a mean value that is distant by $E$ from the previous study.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The margin of error is always associated with a given confidence level.** : \"I measured an average value $\\overline{X}$ on my sample, and I'm 90% sure that the real average lies between $\\overline{X} - E$ and $\\overline{X} + E$\". The interval $[\\overline{X} - E, \\overline{X} + E]$ is called the _confidence interval_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determining the t-value (or z-value)\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-value is determined from statistical distributions, depending on the confidence level that has been chosen for the study. You will never have to compute it by hand. To know which value to use, go to [http://statdistributions.com/t/](http://statdistributions.com/t/). Then follow the steps below :\n",
    "\n",

    "- If you're working with a small sample size (n < 30-40) you'll have to use _Student's distribution_ to determine the t-value. Set the p-value to $1 - \\alpha$ (for example : 0.1) and the degrees of freedom $d.f. = n - 1$\n",
    "- If you're working with a \"big\" sample size (n > 30-40), then you'll have to use the _Normal distribution_. In this case, the t-value is denoted as $z-value$ and it only depends on the p-value. Below are listed the usual z-values:\n",
