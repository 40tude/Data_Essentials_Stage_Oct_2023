    "## What is Hypothesis Testing ?\n",
    "\n",
    "An hypothesis test is simply the idea of testing whether an assumption is true or not by comparing their distributions. To do so, you will: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Formulate two hypothesis $H_0$ and $H_1$ which will be the exact opposite claim of $H_0$\n",
    "2. You will try to negate $H_0$ and therefore accept $H_1$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$H_0$ is also called the **Null hypothesis** while $H_1$ is called the **Alternative Hypothesis**. \n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ You goal will be to negate the null hypothesis and therefore accept the alternative hypothesis ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example to understand this better. Here is a classic one: \n",
    "\n",
    "> *The proportion of male CEOs is greater than 50%*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to formulate $H_0$ and $H_1$: \n",
    "\n",
    "* $H_0$ male CEOs <= 50% ❌\n",
    "* $H_1$ male CEOs > 50% ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what we want to prove is $H_1$, therefore we will try to negate $H_0$. This process can be a little confusing at first but it is actually the only way of proving something is statistics. **We can only prove something wrong instead of proving something right**"
