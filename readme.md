## About the slides with my personal notes
* I use these slides when I'm a TA at JEDHA. They can be useful if you attend the course and want to come back to a particular point.
* The slides are at the root: 00_notes_de_stages.pptx
* Sorry, you can't see them online with Github 
  * You have to download them
  * After that, there's a bit of everything, and depending on whether you're in week 01 or 02, not everything will be useful.
  * If there are comments, there's a green icon in the top right-hand corner.
  * If there are animations, there's a red icon at top left, and of course you have to press SHIFT+F5 to see the slide.

## About the templates of code (Jupyter notebook)
* They are at the root
* Most useful in week 02 

## About code snippets
* See 06-code-snippets\code-snippets.ipynb
* Can be useful for EDA projects in week 2
