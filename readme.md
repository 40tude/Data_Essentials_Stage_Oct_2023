# Notes and projects source code from my "Data Essential" training at JEDHA
* The **Essential** training comes before **Fullstack** and **Lead** trainings :
    * My Notes and Projects of the **Fullstack** training are available [here](https://github.com/40tude/fullstack_mars_2024_3). JEDHA Bootcamp's **Fullstack** training course leads to official professional certification ([RNCP 35_288](https://www.francecompetences.fr/recherche/rncp/35288/)): “Machine Learning Engineer”. 
    * My Notes and Projects of the **Lead** training are available [here](https://github.com/40tude/lead_june_2024). JEDHA Bootcamp's **Lead** training course leads to official professional certification ([RNCP 38_777](https://www.francecompetences.fr/recherche/rncp/38777/)): “Artificial intelligence architect”.
* 2 weeks
* jan 08 - jan 19

## About the set of slides : 00_notes_de_stage.pptx
* I use these slides when I'm a TA at JEDHA. They can be useful if you attend the course and want to come back to a particular point.
* The slides are at the root of the directory tree to make sure they are easily available
* Sorry, you can't see them online with Github 
  * You have to download them
  * After that, there's a bit of everything, and depending on whether you're in week 01 or 02, not everything will be useful.
  * If there are comments under the slide, there's a green icon in the top right-hand corner
  * If there are animations, there's a red icon at top left, and of course you have to press SHIFT+F5 to get the best of the slide

## About the templates of code (Jupyter notebook)
* 01_template_lite_preprocessing.ipynb, 02_..., 03_...
* They are at the root
* Probably best used in week 02 of the course 

## About code snippets
* See 06-code-snippets\code-snippets.ipynb
* Can be useful for EDA projects in week 02

## 99-assets 
* These are mostly personal resources 

# 98-project directories
* This is the [San Francisco project](https://github.com/40tude/Data_Essentials_Stage_Oct_2023/tree/main/98-projet)
    * Feel free to read the slides (.pptx) before to look at the code
    * Many many slides are hidden. Press F5 to run the presentation.
    * We used these slides during the formal presentation at the end of the training
    * I used these slides and some additional technical information to validate Block 6 of the “Machine Learning Engineer” professional certification (RNCP 35_288, Fullstack).

## About contributions
This project was developed for personal and educational purposes. Feel free to explore and use it to enhance your own learning in machine learning.

Given the nature of the project, external contributions are not actively sought or encouraged.
